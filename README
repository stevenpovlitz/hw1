## Created by Steven Povlitz on September 17 for Data Mining HW1

## Description

KNN algorithm implemented on email spam data. statistics.js file from https://gist.github.com/Daniel-Hug/7273430

## Instructions to run:
-inside directory, run command "npm install" to install dependencies
-inside current directory, run with command: "npm start" to begin outputting C answers. Program was previously run for
A and B answers, and their output is shown below

### D) What can you conclude by comparing the KNN performance in (a) and (b)?

It seems z score normalization makes a notable improvement in the average
accuracy of the KNN prediction algorithm.


## Results Problem 2

### Decision Tree
Education gain = .970 (H:4 L:6)
  1. High School = .721 (H:1, L:4)
    Experience = .446
      1. <3yrs (L:1)
      2. 3-10yrs (L:2)
      3. 10<yrs (H:1, L:1)
        Career
          1. Management (H:1)
          2. Service (L:1)
  2. College = .9701 (H: 3, L:2)
    Career = .295
      1. Management (H:2)
      2. Service (H:1, L:2)
        Experience
          1. <3yrs (L:1)
          2. 3-10yrs (H:1)
          3. 10<yrs (L:1)

Pruning decision Tree:
Prune the experience node under College > Career > Experience, because the
2nd and 3rd instance of pruning data causes entropy to increase
